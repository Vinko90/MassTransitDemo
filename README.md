# MassTransit Demo

The following repository contain a demo application I wrote to start playing with Mass Transit and microservices in .NET environment. The idea was to learn extra knowledge and try out different products for building modern scalable distributed systems.
What I wanted to achieve is as follow:
- Build a demo Pub/Sub application with MassTransit and gain knowledge
- Implement a free/open-source platform for distributed logging
- Implement a free/open-source platform for distributed tracing
- Implement a free/open-source platform for distributed monitoring
